<h1>Next JS Concepts Learned</h1>
<ul>
  <li>PPR = Partial Pre-Rendering: Allow to pre-render only certain parts of a page rather than the entire page at once. (experimental)</li>
  <li>ISR --> stands for Incremental Static Regeneration --> allow pages to statiscally generated at build time but also updated incrementally on-demand without requiring a full rebuild of the site</li>
</ul>
